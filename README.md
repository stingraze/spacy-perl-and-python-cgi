# spacy-perl-and-python-cgi
Some new project using NLP I am making since 2020/5/31
Will be a testing ground for new concepts I am learning with Python and Perl. 

Use spacy-test.pl as a CGI to call spacy-test.py. (Tested on Apache 2.4)

spacy-ai-test.py is just a brain-storming script I made to try to mimick how to understand key concepts or subject with NLP.
